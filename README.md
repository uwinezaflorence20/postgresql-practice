Project: Bookstore Database
This project is about managing a bookstore database using SQL. I worked with tables like Books, Customers, and Orders.

What I Did
Updated book data:

Increased the price of The Silent Patient by 5.

Changed stock of Atomic Habits to 25.

Deleted data:

Removed the customer with email john.doe@example.com.

Deleted the order with ID 3.

Fetched data:

Listed all books in the Fiction genre.

Showed all orders with a total amount greater than 50.

Searched for customers whose last name contains "son".

Fixed data types:

Converted text fields like price and total_amount to numbers for calculations.

Set up relationships:

Linked customer_id in Orders to id in Books using a foreign key.
